[sshyp-mfa]
desc = reads mfa/2fa secrets from sshyp entries to generate and copy totp/Steam otp keys to the clipboard
usage = sshyp /<entry name> copy -m<br><br>to add mfa data to a sshyp entry, insert it into the SECOND notes line for a given entry using the following format:<br><br>    otpauth://<OTP METHOD>/<ACCOUNT NAME, NOT USED>?secret=<SECRET>&issuer=<ISSUER, NOT USED>&algorithm=<ALGORITHM>&digits=<DIGITS>&period=<REFRESH PERIOD><br><br>what to put in each of the above spaces:<br><br>    <OTP METHOD> is almost always 'totp', but in the case of Steam, it needs to be set to 'steam'.<br>    <ACCOUNT NAME, NOT USED> is a part of the Authenticator backup format, but it is not used in sshyp-mfa. Set to anything.<br>    <SECRET> refers to the secret used to generate your MFA key. This is usually directly provided by the issuer, but it is sometimes hidden and more easily retrieved by copying it from a QR-compatible MFA app (such as Aegis).<br>    <ISSUER, NOT USED> is a part of the Authenticator backup format, but it is not used in sshyp-mfa. Set to anything.<br>    <ALGORITHM> refers to the algorithm used to generate your MFA key based on your secret. This is almost always 'sha1'.<br>    <DIGITS> refers to the intended length of your MFA key. This is almost always '6', but in the case of Steam, it needs to be set to '5'.<br>    <REFRESH PERIOD> refers to the interval at which a new MFA key needs to be generated. This is almost always '30', for 30 seconds.<br><br>examples:<br><br>    GitHub (standard 6-digit totp):<br>        otpauth://totp/MyNameIsBob?secret=YUGBSG65SG9SDBSDF56SBFVSC86SBVD6&issuer=GitHub&algorithm=sha1&digits=6&period=30<br><br>    Steam (5-character totp):<br>        otpauth://steam/SteamUser?secret=VGVG34GH2GJHVCK7HGVS7&issuer=Steam&algorithm=sha1&digits=5&period=30<br><br>for more information, visit:<br><br>    https://github.com/rwinkhart/sshyp-labs/wiki/sshyp-mfa
